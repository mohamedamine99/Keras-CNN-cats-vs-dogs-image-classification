# Keras-CNN-cats-vs-dogs-image-classification
This project is an image classification project using a deep-learning based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Keras.  
The Dogs vs. Cats is a classic problem for anyone who wants to dive deeper into deep-learning.  
The classifier is based on a rather simple CNN architecture and achieved a test accuracy of 92.37 %.
